The difference between `FROM node:alpine` and `FROM alpine` in a Dockerfile is primarily about what base image you start
with:

- `FROM node:alpine` starts from an Alpine Linux base image that already has the Node.js runtime installed and configured. It
  is an Alpine-based image maintained by the Node.js Docker team (though their Alpine builds are unofficial and somewhat
  experimental). This image is optimized for running Node.js applications with a smaller image size than full Node.js base
  images.

- `FROM alpine` starts from just the plain Alpine Linux base image without Node.js installed. Alpine is a minimal, small
  Linux distribution image (~5MB) known for its simplicity and low overhead, but you'd need to install Node.js yourself if
  you want to run Node.js apps on it.

In short, `node:alpine` is Alpine Linux plus Node.js pre-installed, ready for Node.js apps, whereas `alpine` is just the
lightweight Linux OS with no Node.js included. Choosing `node:alpine` saves setup time for Node.js but may be less flexible
or come with unofficial builds, while `alpine` gives a minimal OS for full custom setups.[1][2][3][8]
