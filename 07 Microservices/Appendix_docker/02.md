Standard input (StdIn), standard output (StdOut), and standard error (StdErr) are the three predefined input/output
communication streams used by computer programs when they start execution.

- **Standard Input (StdIn)** is the data stream from which a program reads its input. Typically, it comes from the keyboard
  or can be redirected from a file or another program's output.

- **Standard Output (StdOut)** is the stream where a program writes its normal output data, usually displayed on the terminal
  or console screen. It can also be redirected to files or piped to other programs.

- **Standard Error (StdErr)** is the stream specifically for outputting error messages and diagnostics. It is separate from
  StdOut to allow error messages to be displayed or logged independently, even if the normal output is redirected.

This separation allows a program to distinguish between regular output and error messages and enables flexible redirection
and chaining of commands in many operating systems.

By default, all three are connected to the terminal, but they can be redirected independently. The file descriptor numbers
for these streams are:

- StdIn: 0
- StdOut: 1
- StdErr: 2

StdErr is often unbuffered to ensure error messages appear immediately.

In summary, these streams provide standard ways for programs to receive input and produce output and error messages, allowing
them to interact efficiently with the user and other programs.[1][2][3]
