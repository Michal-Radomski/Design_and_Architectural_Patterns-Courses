Here is the difference between the Linux signals SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL, and SIGTSTP, along with mention of other similar
signals:

### SIGINT (Signal Interrupt)

- Sent when the user presses Ctrl+C in the terminal.
- It is a **gentle interrupt signal** that asks the process to stop what it's doing and terminate.
- The process can catch this signal and perform cleanup before exiting.
- Typically used to interrupt a running program interactively.

### SIGTERM (Signal Terminate)

- This is the **default termination signal** sent by the kill command.
- It politely **requests the process to terminate**, allowing it to cleanup and shutdown gracefully.
- The process can also catch this signal and handle it.
- Used mostly for safe and controlled process termination, including by system scripts.

### SIGKILL (Signal Kill)

- A **forceful termination signal** that cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored by the process.
- The process is immediately stopped by the OS with no chance for cleanup.
- Should be used as a last resort only when a process is unresponsive to SIGINT or SIGTERM.
- It can lead to issues like resource leaks since no cleanup happens.

### SIGTSTP (Signal Terminal Stop)

- Sent when the user presses Ctrl+Z in the terminal.
- It **suspends (pauses) the process**, putting it into the background.
- The process can be resumed later with a `fg` or `bg` command.
- Useful for temporarily pausing processes without terminating them.

### Other Similar Signals

- **SIGQUIT**: Similar to SIGINT but also causes the process to produce a core dump for debugging.
- **SIGHUP**: Sent when the controlling terminal is closed; often instructs a daemon to reload configuration.
- **SIGSTOP**: Like SIGTSTP but cannot be caught or ignored; immediately pauses the process.
- **SIGCONT**: Resumes a paused process from SIGSTOP or SIGTSTP.

### Summary Table

| Signal  | Description                  | Effect                   | Can be caught? | Sent by default in kill? |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| SIGINT  | User interrupt (Ctrl+C)      | Request graceful stop    | Yes            | No                       |
| SIGTERM | Termination request          | Request graceful stop    | Yes            | Yes                      |
| SIGKILL | Forceful kill                | Immediate termination    | No             | No                       |
| SIGTSTP | Terminal stop (Ctrl+Z)       | Pause/suspend process    | Yes            | No                       |
| SIGQUIT | Quit and core dump           | Request quit + core dump | Yes            | No                       |
| SIGHUP  | Hangup (terminal closed)     | Reload configs           | Yes            | No                       |
| SIGSTOP | Stop process immediately     | Suspend immediately      | No             | No                       |
| SIGCONT | Continue a suspended process | Resume process           | No             | No                       |

In practice, SIGINT and SIGTERM are often used for polite shutdown requests, SIGKILL for forced termination, and SIGTSTP to
suspend a process temporarily.[1][2][3][4][6]
