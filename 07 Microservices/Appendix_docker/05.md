A Docker **image** is a read-only template containing the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration needed
to run a program. It serves as a blueprint or snapshot for creating Docker containers. Images are built from Dockerfiles and
stored in registries for distribution.

A Docker **container** is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It provides an isolated environment where the application
runs, including a writable layer on top of the image's read-only layers. Containers are mutable and exist during runtime;
they can be started, stopped, modified, and deleted. Containers depend on images to be created but can have changes isolated
to themselves without affecting the original image.

In summary, images are immutable templates used to create containers, while containers are the live, running environments
based on those images. Images can be shared and moved around easily, and containers provide the actual execution environment
for applications.[1][2][3]
