In TypeScript, the `implements` keyword is used in a class declaration to indicate that the class must conform to a specific
interface or multiple interfaces. Using `implements` enforces that the class includes all properties and methods defined in
the interface(s), providing a compile-time guarantee of type compatibility.

### What `implements` does:

- Ensures a class has all the members (properties and methods) specified in the interface.
- Helps TypeScript enforce type safety by checking at compile time.
- Allows a class type to be narrowed down to the interface type for stricter type control.
- Causes a compile-time error if the class does not implement the interface correctly.
- Unlike `extends`, which inherits implementation, `implements` only enforces the contract without providing implementation.

### Example:

```typescript
interface HasName {
  name: string;
}

class User implements HasName {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

const amir: HasName = new User("Amir", 36);
console.log(amir.name); // Output: Amir
```

If `User` doesn't declare `name` or defines it with a wrong type, TypeScript will issue an error because the class fails to
satisfy the `HasName` interface.

### Additional notes:

- Using `implements` is not strictly necessary for type compatibility in TypeScript's structural type system, but it provides
  explicitness and better error checking.
- A class can implement multiple interfaces separated by commas.
- If the class fails to implement all required members, TypeScript gives a compile-time error.

In summary, the `implements` keyword in TypeScript lets a class declare that it adheres to a particular interface by having
all required properties and methods, enabling better type safety and contract enforcement during development.[1][5][9]
