The $in and $where operators in Mongoose are used for querying documents with specific conditions:

- The
  $in operator is used to find documents where the value of a specified field matches any value in a given array. It is
  useful for filtering documents that contain one of several possible values in a particular field. For example, { breed: {
  $in:
  ["Pitbull", "Great Dane", "Pug"] } } finds documents where the breed field is one of these values.[1][3][9]

- The $where operator allows passing JavaScript expressions or functions to the query system for more flexible and complex
  querying. It can execute custom JavaScript-based conditions on documents but might impact performance since it executes
  JavaScript on the server side.[6][7]

In summary, $in is for matching against a set of possible values in a field, while $where provides advanced custom query
logic using JavaScript code. Both are part of Mongoose's query capabilities and reflect MongoDB's querying syntax.
