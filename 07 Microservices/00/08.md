The `it.todo` (or equivalently `test.todo`) in Jest is a placeholder method used to mark tests that are planned but not yet
implemented. It allows developers to outline or "todo" tests they intend to write later. When using `test.todo`, Jest will
list these todos in the test summary output, making it easy to keep track of which tests still need to be written. However,
`test.todo` only accepts the test name or description as an argument and throws an error if a test callback function is
provided. It serves as a useful reminder tool in the test suite without running an actual test.

This differs from `test.skip`, which skips a test temporarily but doesn't signify that the test is yet to be created or
completed.

In usage, `test.todo('test description')` or `it.todo('test description')` is placed in test files to indicate tests that
should be implemented in the future.[1][4][6]
