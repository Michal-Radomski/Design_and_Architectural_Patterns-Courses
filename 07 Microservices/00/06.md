The difference between res.send and res.json in Express.js is mainly about how they handle the response data and the content
type they set:

- **res.send()** is a general-purpose method that can send various types of responses like strings, buffers, objects, arrays,
  or booleans. It automatically sets the Content-Type header based on the data type:

  - String or HTML → text/html
  - Buffer → application/octet-stream
  - Object or Array → application/json
  - It does not automatically convert objects to JSON strings but sends the data as is.
  - It is more versatile and can be used to send different types of data without explicitly indicating it's JSON.

- **res.json()** is specifically designed to send JSON responses. It:
  - Automatically converts JavaScript objects (including arrays) to a JSON-formatted string.
  - Explicitly sets the Content-Type header to application/json.
  - Can format the JSON output using replacer and spaces options.
  - Ensures the response charset is utf-8.

In practice, when sending JSON data, using res.json() is more explicit and guarantees the response will be properly
serialized JSON with the correct headers. res.send() can also send JSON if given an object, but it is more generic and may
not handle certain edge cases like null or undefined as cleanly as res.json().

In summary:

| Aspect          | res.send()                               | res.json()                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Content-Type    | Automatically set according to data type | Always application/json                |
| Data handling   | Sends various data types as is           | Converts objects/arrays to JSON string |
| Stringification | No automatic JSON stringification        | Automatic JSON stringification         |
| Use case        | General-purpose sending                  | Sending explicit JSON response         |

So use res.json() when you want to clearly state the response is JSON, and res.send() when your response might be of various
types or when you want the flexibility in content type setting.[1][4][5]
