The code `Object.setPrototypeOf(this, BadRequestError.prototype)` is used to explicitly set the prototype of the current
object (`this`) to the prototype of `BadRequestError`. This is typically done inside the constructor of a custom error class
that extends the built-in `Error` class.

### Why is this needed?

In JavaScript, when you extend a built-in class like `Error`, the prototype chain can get messed up in some environments or
transpiled code (especially before ES6 engines fully supported class inheritance). This means that the instance might not
correctly inherit properties and methods from the custom errorâ€™s prototype.

By calling:

```js
Object.setPrototypeOf(this, BadRequestError.prototype);
```

you manually fix the prototype chain so that the current instance (`this`) correctly links to `BadRequestError.prototype`.
This ensures that:

- The instance passes `instanceof BadRequestError`.
- The instance inherits any custom methods or properties defined on `BadRequestError.prototype`.

### When is this necessary?

- It is mainly needed in ES5 or older environments where native class inheritance is not properly supported.
- It is also common in transpiled TypeScript or Babel code targeting older JavaScript versions.
- In modern ES6+ environments or browsers, this step is usually unnecessary because class inheritance works correctly.

### Summary

The line corrects the prototype chain for the current instance, ensuring it behaves like an instance of the custom error
class. It's a workaround for JavaScript engine quirks when extending built-in classes like `Error`.

This is a widely recommended pattern when creating custom error classes, especially if the code needs to support older
runtimes or transpiled code.
