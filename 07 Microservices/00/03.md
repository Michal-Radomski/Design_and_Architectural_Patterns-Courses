NATS is a high-performance, lightweight, and open-source messaging system designed for real-time communication and
distributed systems. It supports multiple messaging patterns such as publish/subscribe (Pub/Sub), request/reply, and
streaming, making it highly versatile for modern cloud-native and edge-first applications.

Key characteristics of NATS include:

- Ultra-low latency messaging suitable for real-time use
- Simple deployment as a single lightweight binary
- Subject-based addressing for flexible message routing
- Support for clustering, high availability, and scalability
- Optional persistence and streaming through JetStream
- Multi-protocol support including MQTT and WebSockets
- Observability and diagnostics features

NATS is widely used for microservices communication, IoT and edge computing, event-driven architectures, and streaming data
pipelines. It acts as a connective technology enabling seamless message exchange between distributed applications and
services.

In essence, NATS offers a reliable and efficient messaging backbone for building scalable, event-driven systems in diverse
environments. It is maintained as an open-source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
