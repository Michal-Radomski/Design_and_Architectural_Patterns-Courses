A **microservice** is a small, independent, and loosely coupled service designed to perform a specific business function
within an application. It is part of an architectural style called **microservices architecture**, where a single application
is developed as a collection of such autonomous services that communicate with each other through lightweight APIs. Each
microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing flexibility, modularity, and ease of maintenance
compared to traditional monolithic applications.[1][2][5][7][9]

Key characteristics of microservices include:

- Focus on a specific, well-defined business capability (e.g., user authentication, product management).
- Independent codebases usually managed by small teams.
- Their own data or state persistence, rather than sharing a centralized database.
- Communication through standardized interfaces such as RESTful APIs.
- Technology heterogeneity, allowing different services to be implemented using different programming languages or
  frameworks.
- Support for independent deployment and scaling, reducing risks during updates.

Microservices enable more agile development, ease of scaling based on demand per function, and improved fault isolation
across components in complex, often cloud-native, applications.[5][6][7][9][1]

This architecture contrasts with monolithic design, where all functionalities are tightly integrated into a single codebase
and deployment unit.[4][9]

In summary, a microservice is essentially a small, self-contained application component that works in concert with other such
components to form a full-featured software application.[3][10]
