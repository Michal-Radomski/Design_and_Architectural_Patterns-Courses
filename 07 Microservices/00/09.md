The differences between NATS, RabbitMQ, and Kafka mainly revolve around architecture, messaging patterns, performance,
persistence, and use cases:

| Feature                    | NATS                                                                   | RabbitMQ                                                | Kafka                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**           | Lightweight, simple message broker                                     | Traditional message broker with queues                  | Distributed log system (event streaming)                 |
| **Messaging Model**        | Pub-Sub, Request-Reply, Queue Groups                                   | Flexible routing with AMQP; Pub-Sub, Work Queues        | Append-only log with Consumer Groups for scaled pub-sub  |
| **Persistence**            | Optional with JetStream                                                | Durable queues with message persistence                 | Always durable and persistent logs                       |
| **Message Ordering**       | Per subject                                                            | Per queue                                               | Per partition (strict ordering)                          |
| **Delivery Guarantees**    | At-most-once, some support for at-least-once                           | At-least-once, supports transactions                    | At-least-once with exactly-once capabilities             |
| **Performance**            | Extremely low latency, high throughput (millions msgs/sec)             | Moderate latency, lower throughput (thousands msgs/sec) | High throughput, designed for large scale data pipelines |
| **Scalability**            | Clustering and mesh networking                                         | Clustering with mirrored queues                         | Highly scalable with partitioning and replication        |
| **Typical Use Cases**      | Real-time messaging, microservices communication, cloud-native systems | Enterprise applications, complex routing scenarios      | Event sourcing, stream processing, big data pipelines    |
| **Protocol Support**       | Custom binary protocol                                                 | AMQP, MQTT, STOMP                                       | Custom binary protocol                                   |
| **Operational Complexity** | Low, easy to deploy and configure                                      | Moderate, requires tuning and management                | High, complex to setup and operate                       |

### Summary:

- **NATS** is optimized for simplicity, speed, and low-latency messaging, ideal for microservices and real-time cloud
  applications.
- **RabbitMQ** provides mature enterprise messaging features, complex routing, and protocol support, suited for traditional
  applications needing reliable message queuing.
- **Kafka** is designed for high-throughput, durable event streaming and data pipelines, commonly used for big data and
  stream processing.

Choosing among them depends on priorities like performance, message durability, complexity, and intended usage
patterns.[1][2][3]
