A microfrontend setup with Vite and React typically involves creating a host application and one or more remote applications
that expose components or features to be consumed by the host. The integration is often done using a Module Federation plugin
adapted for Vite, such as `@originjs/vite-plugin-federation`, since Vite does not use Webpack natively.

Here is an overview of the setup:

1. **Host Application Setup**:

   - Create a React app using Vite:
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest host-app -- --template react
     ```
   - Install dependencies and add the federation plugin:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm install @originjs/vite-plugin-federation
     ```
   - Configure `vite.config.js` to consume remote federated modules:

     ```js
     import { defineConfig } from "vite";
     import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
     import federation from "@originjs/vite-plugin-federation";

     export default defineConfig({
       plugins: [
         react(),
         federation({
           name: "host-app",
           remotes: {
             remoteApp: "http://localhost:5001/assets/remoteEntry.js",
           },
           shared: ["react", "react-dom"],
         }),
       ],
       build: {
         modulePreload: false,
         target: "esnext",
         minify: false,
         cssCodeSplit: false,
       },
     });
     ```

2. **Remote Application Setup**:

   - Similarly, create a React app with Vite:
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest remote-app -- --template react
     npm install
     npm install @originjs/vite-plugin-federation
     ```
   - Configure it to expose components in `vite.config.js`:

     ```js
     import { defineConfig } from "vite";
     import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
     import federation from "@originjs/vite-plugin-federation";

     export default defineConfig({
       plugins: [
         react(),
         federation({
           name: "remoteApp",
           filename: "remoteEntry.js",
           exposes: {
             "./Button": "./src/components/Button",
           },
           shared: ["react", "react-dom"],
         }),
       ],
       build: {
         modulePreload: false,
         target: "esnext",
         minify: false,
         cssCodeSplit: false,
       },
     });
     ```

   - Build and serve the remote app so the host can load its components dynamically.

3. **Usage**:

   - In the host app React code, you import remote components dynamically and integrate routes as needed:

     ```jsx
     import Button from 'remoteApp/Button';

     function App() {
       return (

           Host Application


       );
     }
     ```

This setup enables independently developed and deployed React microfrontends with fast builds thanks to Vite. The federation
plugin mimics Webpack Module Federation's capabilities using native ES module dynamic imports without relying on Webpack,
preserving Vite's speed advantages[1][4][5].

Additional tooling like Vike (built on Vite) can also be used for SSR and more complex scenarios in microfrontend
architecture[3]. Detailed examples and further configuration can be found in articles and sample GitHub repos demonstrating
microfrontends with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Module Federation plugins[1][4][5][9].
