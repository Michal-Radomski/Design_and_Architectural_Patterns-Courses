**Module Federation** is a software architecture technique primarily used in web development that enables a large application
to be split into smaller, independent modules which can be loaded dynamically on demand. It allows multiple JavaScript
applications or micro-frontends to share code and resources at runtime, promoting modularity, scalability, and independent
deployment.

Key points about Module Federation:

- It works by having a **host application** that loads and manages multiple **remote modules** asynchronously, which are
  independent applications exposing their own components or code for sharing.
- Modules can be developed, tested, deployed, and updated independently by different teams, leading to faster development
  cycles and improved team autonomy.
- It is framework-agnostic and works across various JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and also with Node.js.
- Module Federation reduces bundle sizes by loading code on demand and shares dependencies between applications to avoid
  duplication.
- Introduced and popularized by Webpack 5, it mimics the backend microservices architecture but for frontend applications.
- Common terms include _host_ (the app consuming remote modules), _remote_ (the app exposing modules), and _federated
  modules_ (the shared code).
- It supports scalable, maintainable, and efficient large-scale web applications and is used to build micro-frontend
  architectures.

This pattern improves modularity, performance, and maintainability by enabling applications to function as a collection of
independently deliverable units while sharing code dynamically and seamlessly.[1][2][3][6][7]
