The syntax `import("./bootstrap")` in JavaScript is a dynamic import, which is a function-like expression allowing you to
asynchronously load an ECMAScript module at runtime rather than statically at compile time. It returns a promise that
resolves to the module namespace object containing all its exports.

This enables loading the module only when needed, which can improve performance and flexibility, especially in non-module
environments or for code splitting.

Key points about the syntax and behavior:

- It looks like a function call but `import` is a keyword, not a function.
- The argument is a string specifying the module path.
- It returns a promise that resolves when the module is loaded and evaluated.
- If loading fails or the module throws an error while evaluating, the promise rejects.
- You can then use `.then()` or `await` to access the imported module's exports.

For example:

```js
import("./bootstrap")
  .then((module) => {
    // Use the exported properties or functions from bootstrap here
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle loading or evaluation errors
  });
```

This contrasts with the static `import` statement, which must be at the top-level and is synchronous in module resolution,
like:

```js
import * as bootstrap from "./bootstrap";
```

Dynamic imports are especially useful in scenarios like lazy loading components or libraries only when they're actually
needed during execution.

This explanation is based on the MDN Web Docs explanation of the dynamic `import()` syntax.[1][3]
