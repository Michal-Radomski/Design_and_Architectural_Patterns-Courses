React Router V5! The main difference between **Browser History** and **Memory History** in React Router DOM is how they
manage and interact with the navigation history and URL:

- **Browser History** uses the HTML5 History API to manipulate the browser's actual address bar and URL. This means it
  updates the URL in the browser address bar and keeps it in sync with the UI, allowing navigation through real URLs using
  the browser’s back, forward buttons, and direct URL input. It is suitable for web applications where SEO and bookmarkable
  URLs are important.[1][2][4][7]

- **Memory History**, on the other hand, keeps the history stack in memory only and does **not** read or write to the
  browser’s address bar. It manages navigation internally without changing the URL visible to the user. This is useful for
  environments where there is no browser or you do not want to affect the URL, such as in tests, React Native apps, or
  server-side rendering.[2][8][9][1]

In summary:

| Aspect                       | Browser History                           | Memory History                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| URL reflected in address bar | Yes, URL updates with navigation          | No, URL stays the same (no address bar changes)   |
| Use case                     | Web apps requiring SEO, user-visible URLs | Tests, server rendering, non-browser environments |
| Navigation control           | Uses browser’s HTML5 history API          | Keeps history internally in memory                |

Browser History is the default for regular web apps whereas Memory History is specialized for testing or non-browser
environments.[8][9][1][2]

This difference is foundational to how routing behaves in a React Router application depending on whether you want real URLs
visible or internal route state only.
